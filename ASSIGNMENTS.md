# LangGraph Parallel-Workflow Assignment

## Overview

This project is now being used as a **Home Renovation Planner** example. The
reference pattern is the same LangGraph workflow, but the use case has been
changed to help a user plan a renovation based on a space, budget, and goals.

Study the project files in this repo, especially `home-renovation-planner.py`,
so your graph follows the same core structure:

```text
[Client Brief] -> [Plan Layout] -> [Plan Materials] -> [Estimate Budget]
                     |
                     +-> [Decision Node] -> [Refresh Plan or Remodel Plan]
```

---

## What You Must Build

Using the same LangGraph patterns from the reference code:

- `StateGraph` - to create the graph
- A Pydantic state model - to define data fields
- Node functions - each node must do one clear job
- A planning flow that gathers layout, materials, and budget details
- One decision node that reads the planning outputs
- One conditional routing function
- At least 2 possible final output nodes
- `ChatOpenAI` - for LLM-based reasoning
- A `run_<your_project>()` function - as the main entry point

This repo is now focused on a renovation-planning workflow, so the final output
should be a recommendation such as a `Refresh` plan or a `Remodel` plan.

## Submission Steps

1. Fork or clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Create your own Python file, for example `resume_review_graph.py`.
3. Do not modify `mental_wellness_graph.py`.
4. Build your assigned use case using the same LangGraph structure.
5. Test it end-to-end with your OpenAI key.
6. Push your code to a new public GitHub repository under your own account.
7. Share the GitHub link in the Excel sheet shared on WhatsApp.

Your repo must contain:

- Your LangGraph `.py` file
- A `requirements.txt`
- A `.env.example` file
- A `.gitignore`
- A `README.md` explaining what your graph does and how to run it

Never commit your real `.env` file or API key.
